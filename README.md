JETBOT PROJECT - MRE 462 - SIUE SPRING 2024 
In this project we used a jetbot, all information to set it up can be found in the link below. 


Once your jetbot is set up you can connect and for our first part we did example 2, code can be found in [Controller] file.
Following the jetbot guidance you can easily view your controller inputs as well as run the 
robot using your controller.
We chose to use both a controller with two joysticks. This allowed us to run the robot with the left stick controlling X
and the right controller running Y.
Once this was done and working we were able to set it on the course and see it run.


For the second part of the project we focused on road following and collission avoidance. 
For this we followed example 3 and 4,these required us to sit down and take around YYY number of pictures once that training was 
done we were able to run it and see where we needed to add more pictures. While training we 
could see through the robots camera and choose to either block or run in that position as well as 
where it needed to be moving from its current position. One thing we did notice is that
unless the error gain was at 99% the jetbot would not run correctly.
